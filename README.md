GSPR is a novel multimodal place recognition network based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. It harmonizes multi-view camera and LiDAR data into a unified 
explicit scene representation through the proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, and extracts spatio-temporally discriminative global descriptors
for query-database matching.<br>
